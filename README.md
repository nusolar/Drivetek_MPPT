Drivetek_MPPT
=============

Drivetek_MPPT This code came from Cal Sol (Berkeley CA) solar car team. We at NUsolar have copies of the v3.0 versions (v4.0 shown below). We plan to change the operating values in this code. It is critical to note that Cal Sol has licensed this as GPL2. Any update that is made to this code must be shared. 

According to drivetek, the compiled hex file can be uploaded to the MPPT's using a ICD2/3 or a Pickit. We plan on using a Pickit 3 to upload the code.

Currently no changes have been made to this repository. We will update the readme with the results of our upgrades when they are completed.

For questions, please contact engineering@nusolar.org or team@nusolar.org
